My solutions to the exercises in [R for Data Science (Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham)](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). _The chapters without exercises will not be listed here._

You can check the **solutions in the pdf file** (created using RMarkdown) or in the **.R files** which are organized in separated folders (one folder for each chapter that contains exercises).
